# Countdown

This project is a small implementation of the classic **Countdown** numbers and
letters game.  Start either the numbers or letters round and try to reach the
target before the timer runs out.

### Tamil Letters Round

When starting the letters round you can choose the Tamil edition.  In this mode
three buttons are provided:

* **Vowel** – pick a standalone Tamil vowel.
* **Consonant** – pick a standalone Tamil consonant.
* **Uyirmei** – pick a compound letter that combines a consonant with a vowel
  sign.

Uyirmei letters are generated from every consonant and possible vowel sign and
are validated as single tiles when checking your word.
